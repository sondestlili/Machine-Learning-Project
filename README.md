With the rapid growth in network-based applications, many security tools have been developed in order to detect malicious activities and attacks. Machine learning methods are considered as one of the predominant approaches to intrusion detection. 

In this context, the ML project aims at reproducing the 2 competitive following papers related to intrusion detection:

- Paper1: Study on Decision Tree and KNN Algorithm for Intrusion Detection System 
- Paper2: Anomaly Detection Using Gaussian Mixture Probability Model to Implement Intrusion Detection System
